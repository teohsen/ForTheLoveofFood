## 3. Learning points


### YoloV4 Custom Dataset

  - Every of custom training, the object detection & recognition becomes more accurate (the bounding box
    shown becomes more suppressed and better) (Big duh, with decreasing avg loss)
    
  - Always check the Labels...less end up with a sushi but tagged as a shiba inu
